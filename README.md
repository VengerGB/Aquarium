# Aquarium
## A peer to peer aquarium simulator.

This is a very simple implementation at the moment - really just for my own amusement.

+ Just using simple flocking behaviour to simulate fish schooling. 
+ Some very basic genetics when fish are bred together (inheritance, mutation, etc.)
+ Fish have physical attributes which define their (basic) appearance.
+ Aquariums can connect to other aquariums found on the network.
+ Fish *should* travel away from aquariums which are unsuitable (dirty) to peers.
